# Element Crystal Tower Defense

## Overview

**Element Crystal Tower Defense** is a tower defense game developed in Python using the Pygame library. Instead of traditional towers, you deploy various Element Crystals (Fire, Water, Air, Earth, Darkness, Light, and Life) to defend against waves of enemy bugs. Each crystal type has its own unique attributes and costs.

## Gameplay

In this game, you must strategically place and upgrade your Element Crystals to stop enemy bugs as they traverse a predetermined path. The game includes:

- **Multiple Tower Types:** Choose from seven different crystals, each with unique stats like range, damage, cooldown, and cost.
- **Waves of Enemies:** Press SPACE to spawn waves of enemy bugs with increasing difficulty. Each wave increases enemy health, speed, and rewards.
- **Currency System:** You start with a limited amount of money. Placing and upgrading towers deducts funds, while killing enemies rewards you with more money.
- **Tower Upgrades:** Right-click on a tower to upgrade it (for a fixed cost), which improves its damage, range, and shooting frequency.
- **Game Over:** Lose a life whenever an enemy reaches the end of the path, and the game ends when you run out of lives.

## Controls

- **1 - 7:** Switch the currently selected Element Crystal type.
  - 1: Fire
  - 2: Water
  - 3: Air
  - 4: Earth
  - 5: Darkness
  - 6: Light
  - 7: Life
- **SPACE:** Spawn a new wave of enemies.
- **Left-click:** Place a tower (if you have sufficient funds).
- **Right-click:** Upgrade an existing tower (costs \$50).
- **ESC:** Quit the game.

Note: Currently, only the main 7 types (Fire, Water, Air, Earth, Darkness, Light, and Life) are selectable using keys 1â€“7. The additional Element Crystal types listed below are envisioned for future updates and not yet mapped to controls.
